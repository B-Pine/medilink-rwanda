# Requirements traceability matrix

Status: v0.1 · 2026-10-17 · Every `FR-*` and `NFR-*` requirement in the [system analysis](../README.md), with its planned sprint, the side that implements it, how it is verified, and its status. How to keep it up to date: [QA README](README.md).

Built from the requirement tables in `docs/analysis/` (titles shortened; the analysis documents are authoritative) and the sprint plans in the [backend](../roadmap/backend.md) and [frontend](../roadmap/frontend.md) roadmaps.

## How to read it

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | P1–P4 as in the analysis ([16 · Roadmap and phasing](../analysis/16-roadmap-and-phasing.md)) |
| **Sprint** | M1 sprint(s) from the roadmaps. The first sprint builds it; later ones extend or verify it at scale. `*` = inferred from the roadmap build lists (the requirement isn't named in a sprint's "Requirements" line; confirm in the sprint contract). `—` = later phase. |
| **Side** | Backend, Frontend, Both, or Ops (infrastructure and process outside the two codebases) |
| **Verification** | How acceptance is shown (codes below; details in the [testing strategy](../development/testing-strategy.md)) |
| **Status** | Not started · In progress · Implemented · Verified · Accepted (definitions in the [QA README](README.md) §3) |

| Code | Verification method |
|---|---|
| UT | Unit test |
| API | Backend integration test against PostgreSQL |
| AZ | Authorisation matrix test (role × own / other facility / other patient) |
| RLS | Cross-tenant and row-level security test |
| BR | Business-rule test (state machines, ordering, money, concurrency) |
| CMP | Frontend component test with axe |
| E2E | End-to-end test (Playwright) |
| CON | Contract test (OpenAPI schema vs generated types and MSW mocks) |
| PERF | Load or performance test |
| SEC | Security test or scan (CI gates, ZAP, penetration test) |
| A11Y | Manual accessibility audit (keyboard, screen readers) |
| USA | Usability test with real users (timed where the requirement has a time) |
| INS | Inspection: review of configuration, documents, outputs or evidence |
| DRL | Drill or exercise (restore test, incident tabletop, paper fallback) |

## Findings from building this matrix

These need a decision in the analysis or the roadmaps; the requirement meanings were not changed here.

| # | Finding | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 220 requirement IDs, no duplicate IDs and no gaps in any numbering sequence. | All module documents |
| 2 | Some IDs are planned in two sprints: FR-ACC-05..07 (S0 and S2), FR-PAT-02 (S0 contract and S3), FR-SCH-05..06 (S2 and S5), FR-BIL-02 and FR-BIL-05 (S2 and S8), FR-DOC-03 (S1 and S7), FR-ONB-09 (S2 and S11). The sprint contracts should state which part each sprint delivers. | [Backend roadmap](../roadmap/backend.md) |
| 3 | P1 requirements not named in any sprint's requirement line (assigned here with `*`): FR-AI-02, FR-SEC-11, NFR-NET-01..06, NFR-UX-02..07, NFR-INT-01; NFR-PERF and NFR-REL are named only as groups in S11. | Roadmaps |
| 4 | The S4 queue sprint includes check-in of booked patients and the Expected list (FR-QUE-02, 03, 06), but bookings arrive in S5. | [API catalogue](../api/catalogue.md#s4--visits-and-the-live-queue)  **Resolved** (roadmaps, permission matrix, NFR-UX-03 and security docs aligned). |
| 5 | FR-ACC-09 (super admin emergency access) is listed in S0, but break-glass (FR-SEC-09) is built in S6. FR-SEC-06 (S0) includes the idle lock with PIN unlock, which the Sprint 0 contract doesn't cover. | Backend roadmap, Sprint 0 contract  **Resolved** (roadmaps, permission matrix, NFR-UX-03 and security docs aligned). |
| 6 | The permission matrix (analysis 02 §3) gives merge requests to the facility admin and nothing to the receptionist; analysis 04 §3.2 and security 11 §6 say the receptionist requests and the facility admin approves. | Analysis 02, 04  **Resolved** (roadmaps, permission matrix, NFR-UX-03 and security docs aligned). |
| 7 | The permission matrix gives the receptionist no right to raise a dispute; analysis 10 §3 and FR-DSP-09 let the receptionist raise one at the counter. | Analysis 02, 10  **Resolved** (roadmaps, permission matrix, NFR-UX-03 and security docs aligned). |
| 8 | NFR-UX-03 says WCAG 2.1 AA; design research 10 and the security compliance mapping use WCAG 2.2 AA (which includes 2.1). | Analysis 14, design research 10  **Resolved** (roadmaps, permission matrix, NFR-UX-03 and security docs aligned). |
