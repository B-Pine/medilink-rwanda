# Phase-1 endpoint catalogue

Status: v0.1 · 2026-10-17 · **Plan only.** Implemented endpoints are defined by the generated OpenAPI schema (`GET /api/v1/schema/`); see [README](README.md) §1 for how the two relate, the status values, the permission codes († = proposed) and the note abbreviations (Idem, Ver, Step-up, RL, Audit, Async).

Sprints and requirements follow the [backend](../roadmap/backend.md) and [frontend](../roadmap/frontend.md) roadmaps. Conventions: [architecture 02](../architecture/02-api-conventions.md).

## S4 · Visits and the live queue

Requirements: FR-QUE-01..17. Tests: concurrency (parallel call next and check-in) and the 06:00–10:00 peak (NFR-PERF-01, 04).

Dependency: the roadmap puts check-in of booked patients and the Expected list (FR-QUE-02, 03, 06) in S4, but bookings arrive in S5. The booked check-in and remote-join endpoints are listed in S5; S4 builds the queue with walk-ins plus seeded bookings and remote tickets. The S4 contract must confirm this split.
