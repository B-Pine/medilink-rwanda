# Kinyarwanda strings: native-speaker review

Keys: 6244.

Status: **every Kinyarwanda string below is a draft that needs native-speaker review.** None of
them is final (docs/design/research/10-accessibility-and-localization.md §3, NFR-UX-01). Medical
terms must also be checked with clinicians. Review with real users (elderly patients, reception
staff) before the pilot.

How to review: correct the text in the `rw.json` file named in each section, then run
`pnpm i18n:review` to regenerate this list. Change a row's status only in the review tracker
agreed with the team; this file is generated.

Also to confirm:

- The emergency number shown to patients (`emergency.body`, currently **912**).
- Facility type and role names (`facility.types.*`, `facility.roles.*`).
- The mock API messages in `packages/api-client/src/mocks/messages.ts` (development only).
