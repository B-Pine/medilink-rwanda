"""Reminders (upgrade 13 W7) through the S9 engine: `notify()` with one dedupe key per item and
moment, so each reminder goes out once however often the job runs.

- Booked visits: each patient's reminder offsets (preferences, default 24 hours and 2 hours
  before).
- Follow-up dates the doctor set without a booking, and planned vaccinations and antenatal
  visits (the care schedule): the day before at 08:00 and on the morning at 07:00 (Kigali).

Rules for every item: a moment counts only after it has passed and only if the item already
existed then (a visit booked an hour ahead gets no "24 hours before"). When the job was down and
several moments passed, only the latest goes out. Channel choices, quiet hours and alerts switched
off for a dependant are the engine's (preferences.py, recipients.py). The texts are generic: no
service, test, vaccine or visit-type names.
