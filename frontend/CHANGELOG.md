## [Unreleased]

<!-- Wave 1: each sprint writes ONLY under its own heading; consolidated into Added/Changed/Fixed at release. -->

### Sprint 1 · Platform and onboarding

- api-client: `masterData`, `onboarding`, `security` and `uploads` modules (XHR uploads with
  progress, fetch fallback); `StaffMe.feature_flags` and `security`; `session_locked` error code;
  a `headers` request option for `Idempotency-Key`. MSW mocks for every S1 endpoint (uploads clean
  after two polls, `eicar` infected, 10 MB limit, mock PIN `4826`, `mock-resume-token`).
- ui: DataTable (server sorting and pagination, `aria-sort`, filter chips, densities remembered,
  states, card list under 640 px), SidePanel, Dialog and ConfirmDialog, Tabs, SwitchField,
  TextareaField, Stepper, FileUpload, DocumentViewer (images and lazily loaded pdf.js) and Timeline.
- staff-web `lock`: idle lock after `lock_after_seconds` with a 60 s warning, lock screen (PIN or
  password, attempts left, switch user, cross-tab sync, shown alone on reload), step-up dialog
  that retries the action once, `/account/security` (PIN), Lock and Security in the user menu.
- patient-web `facilityApplication`: `/for-facilities`, start form, five-step wizard with
  autosave, location cascade, document uploads with scan status, reviewer feedback, "continue
  later", resume links and the submitted page.
- staff-web `platform`: overview, applications pipeline and review (documents, verdicts, notes,
  history, request changes, approve, reject), facilities (status actions with reasons, licences,
  history, feature flags), master data (tables, rw/en/fr editor, retire and restore, history, CSV
  import preview and confirm) and feature flags. Navigation entries for platform admins only.
- Dependencies: Radix dialog, tabs and switch; `@tanstack/react-table` 8; `pdfjs-dist` 6.

### Sprint 3 · Patients and identity

### Sprint 9 · Notifications

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

Sprint 0 (Foundations), built against MSW mocks of the
[Sprint 0 contract](../docs/architecture/03-sprint-0-contract.md). Requires API `/api/v1` 0.1.0.

### Added

- pnpm workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) with shared TypeScript (strict), ESLint and Prettier
  configuration; scripts `dev`, `dev:mock`, `build`, `build:mock`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`,
  `format`, `icons`, `i18n:review`, `generate-types`.
- `@medilink/ui`: design tokens from design research 02 (light and dark, system preference plus
  `data-theme` override), staff and patient density, Tailwind CSS v4 theme on the tokens,
  self-hosted Figtree and Inter, focus ring and reduced-motion base styles, and the components
  Button, Field, TextField, PasswordField, CheckboxField, SelectField, ErrorSummary, Alert, Badge,
  Card, Spinner, Skeleton, Logo, LanguageSwitcher, ThemeToggle, VisuallyHidden, SkipLink, Menu
  and an Imigongo-inspired pattern.
- i18n with i18next: Kinyarwanda (default), English and French; `<html lang>` follows the
  language; Kinyarwanda drafts listed for native-speaker review in `i18n-review.md`.
- `@medilink/api-client`: typed fetch client (credentials, CSRF bootstrap and refresh,
  `Accept-Language`, typed `ApiError`, 401 hook), typed functions for every Sprint 0 endpoint,
  `generate-types` stub for openapi-typescript.
- MSW handlers for the Sprint 0 contract, including the MFA flows and error cases, with
  documented mock accounts.
- Staff web: split-screen login, MFA setup (QR, manual key, recovery codes) and verify (code or
  recovery code), facility picker, app shell (sidebar by permissions, facility switcher,
  connection indicator, user menu with theme, language and logout), Today placeholder, section
  placeholders, password reset, 404, session route guard.
- Patient web: public landing skeleton, email-first login, sign-up with consent step, patient
  home placeholder, logout, password reset, placeholder public pages, 404, installable PWA that
  never caches `/api/`.
- Favicons, PWA icons and web logos generated from `brand/logo/source/` by `scripts/generate-icons.mjs`.
- Tests: Vitest + Testing Library + vitest-axe (flows against the mocks, accessibility on key
  pages, token values and contrast, i18n parity, security guards, lint rule).
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` (install, lint, format, typecheck, test, build).

### Security

- No tokens in browser storage; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and `innerHTML` banned by lint; no
  third-party scripts, fonts or CDNs; CSP meta tag in builds; mocks excluded from production
  builds; service worker never caches API responses; caches cleared on patient logout.
